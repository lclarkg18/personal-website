# This is my personal website!

### About

I used React + TypeScript and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a CSS framework to help with the aesthetics.

Other technologies:

- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com) to make the site multilingual, setting the language to the browser's default but allowing a user to change manually if they would rather see it in a different one.

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) to create a multi-level navigation structure that enables a seamless multilingual experience.

### To run it locally

In the project directory, you can run `npm start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can also run `npm test` to check that everything is working as expected.
